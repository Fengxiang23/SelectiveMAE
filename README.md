## Intruduction
-  `RS-4M`: A large-scale remote sensing dataset. This dataset, comprising 4 million optical images, 
is designed to fully leverage the representation learning capabilities of MIM methods in RS applications, distinguished by its diverse scene details.</br>
- `SelectiveMAE`: A novel and efficient MIM method tailored for remote sensing images. This method incorporates a new PSTS module,
which significantly accelerates convergence and enhances representation learning compared to the original MIM approach.


## Todo List
- [x] Initial release of checkpoint of SelectiveMAE. ðŸš€
- [x] Codes and configs for downstream tasks of SelectiveMAE, Scene Classification. ðŸš€
- [ ] Codes and configs for downstream tasks of SelectiveMAE, Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation. 
- [ ] Pretraining codes and configs for SelectiveMAE will be released.
- [ ] RS-4M dataset will be released.



## Updates

- \[2024.06\] - The training logs of the SelectiveMAE and the codes of classification in fintuning have been released.
